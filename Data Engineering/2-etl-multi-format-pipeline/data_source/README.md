# ETL Practice Exercise

This directory contains an additional ETL implementation developed
as a practice exercise.

The pipeline processes CSV, JSON, and XML files containing vehicle
data, applies transformations, and outputs a clean dataset.

The goal of this exercise is to reinforce ETL fundamentals using
a different schema and dataset.
