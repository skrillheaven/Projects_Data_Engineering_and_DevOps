# Microservices Application using Serverless Architecture

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a
microservices-based application using a **serverless architecture**
on a managed cloud platform.

The focus of the project is on service decomposition, independent
deployment, API integration, and frontend-to-backend communication
using cloud-native serverless services.

---

## Project Overview

The application is composed of multiple backend microservices and
a frontend web application.

Each backend service is deployed independently as a serverless
application and exposes REST APIs that are consumed by the frontend.
The frontend aggregates data from multiple services to present
a unified user experience.

This architecture demonstrates how microservices can be developed,
deployed, and operated without managing underlying infrastructure.

---

## Architecture

The system is composed of the following components:

### Backend Microservices
- **Product Details Service (Python)**
  - Exposes product-related information through REST endpoints
  - Deployed as an independent serverless service

- **Dealer Details Service (Node.js)**
  - Exposes dealer and pricing information
  - Deployed independently from other services

Each backend service has its own deployment lifecycle and endpoint,
illustrating loose coupling and service autonomy.

### Frontend Application
- Web-based frontend application
- Consumes backend APIs using HTTP requests
- Aggregates responses from multiple microservices
- Deployed as a serverless application

---

## Service Integration Flow

1. Backend microservices are deployed independently
2. Public service endpoints are generated by the platform
3. Frontend configuration is updated to consume backend endpoints
4. Frontend application is deployed
5. End-to-end functionality is validated through user interactions

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Microservices architecture
- Serverless application deployment
- Independent service lifecycle management
- REST API integration
- Frontend-to-backend service communication
- Cloud-managed infrastructure abstraction

---

## Evidence

Execution and deployment evidence for this project is available in
the `evidence/` directory and includes:

- Backend service deployments
- Frontend deployment and configuration
- End-to-end integration and functional validation

---

## Notes

This project focuses on architectural design, service integration,
and operational behavior rather than local code implementation.
It reflects real-world scenarios where teams work with managed
platforms and distributed services.
