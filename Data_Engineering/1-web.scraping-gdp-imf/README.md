# Web Scraping – Top 10 Largest Economies by GDP (IMF)

This project demonstrates a data extraction and processing workflow
using Python and web scraping techniques.

The objective is to extract and process the **top 10 largest economies
in the world**, ranked by **GDP in Billion USD**, based on publicly
available data reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

## Project Scenario

An international firm seeking to expand its business globally requires
accurate and up-to-date economic indicators to support strategic
decision-making.

As a junior Data Engineer, the task is to develop a script capable of
extracting GDP data from an external web source, processing it, and
producing a ranked dataset of the top economies worldwide.

## Notebook Overview

The Jupyter Notebook included in this project performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves GDP data from an external web source
2. Parses and extracts relevant economic indicators
3. Cleans and normalizes the data
4. Converts GDP values to Billion USD
5. Rounds values to two decimal places
6. Sorts and ranks the top 10 economies in descending order

## Output

The final output is a processed dataset displaying:
- Country name
- GDP value (Billion USD)
- Ranked from highest to lowest GDP
