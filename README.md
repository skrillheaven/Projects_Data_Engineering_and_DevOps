# Data Engineering & DevOps Portfolio

This repository serves as a centralized portfolio showcasing
hands-on projects developed as part of my growth and specialization
in **Data Engineering** and **DevOps**.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical experience
through real implementations, focusing on architecture, automation,
containerization, orchestration, and operational best practices.

Each project is self-contained, documented, and supported by
execution evidence where applicable.

---

## Purpose of This Portfolio

This portfolio was created to:

- Consolidate technical projects in one place
- Demonstrate applied skills beyond theoretical knowledge
- Showcase real-world tooling and workflows
- Track continuous learning and professional growth

Projects are organized by domain and complexity, and new projects
will be added progressively.
